#Core Code

Within this folder, I created the core code for my JSP project from scratch, including all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSP. The 'docs/' and 'images/' folders contain my work to provide the .jpeg and .pdf features. 

The material in the folder 'twoColumnLayout/' was my first run at the div layout I eventually used for the site.

The site was uploaded to OpenShift using a ROOT.war file, so I had to use the 'index.html' file to point to the 'about.html' file in order to get the server to display 'about.html' as my landing page.

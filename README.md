#[formProject_JSP](http://jspformproject-accjavabridges.rhcloud.com/about.html)
This web project demos how to use JSP to perform server-side processing on a simple HTML form.

I built this project with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSP. I developed it locally using: 
- Apache Tomcat 8.0.15
- Java jdk 1.80_31 / jre7
- NetBeans IDE 8.02 

The folder structure in this repo is from a NetBeans build. The **['web/'](web/)** folder is the one that contains my code work. 

You may view this project online at **[OpenShift](http://jspformproject-accjavabridges.rhcloud.com/about.html)**.
(Note: there may be a slow load time while OpenShift spins up the environment).
